## 🎓 Personal Information

**Student:** Humure Enock  
**ID:** 27394  
**Program:** AUCA - IT - Software Engineering  
**Course:** INSY 8311 | Database Development with PL/SQL  
**Faculty:** Information Technology - AUCA  
**Lecturer:** Eric Maniraguha  
**Group:** Wednesday(C)  
**Project Title:** Patient Disease Tracking & Analytics System (PDTAS)

## 🏥 Project Overview

This is a multi-phase individual capstone project centered on Oracle database design, PL/SQL development, and Business Intelligence implementation. The project serves as the FINAL EXAM and significantly impacts the course grade.

## 🔍 Problem Analysis

**Current Challenge:** Healthcare providers lack a unified system to track patient flows and disease-specific outcomes across reception, clinical, and lab departments. This makes it hard to monitor disease incidence, patient follow-ups, and resource allocation for Malaria, HIV/AIDS, Stunting, Respiratory Infections, and Diarrheal Diseases.

**Research Question:** Can we predict workplace injury patterns? (Note: This appears to be from a different project - maintaining original text)

## 🛠 Solution Architecture

**System Solution:** A PL/SQL-backed Patient Tracking System that records patient registration, clinical encounters, diagnostics and treatments and produces BI-ready data for disease surveillance and decision-making.

## 🏛 Implementation Context

**Usage Environment:** Used in hospital outpatient departments and clinics to capture patient identity, visit lifecycle (reception → clinician → lab → treatment → follow-up) and disease-specific details.

**Target User Groups:**
- Receptionists
- Doctors  
- Lab Technicians
- Pharmacists
- Hospital Managers
- Public Health Analysts

## 🎯 Project Objectives

**Primary Goals:**
- Accurate patient tracking
- Audit trail of all actions
- Disease incidence reports
- KPI dashboards (incidence rates, treatment outcomes, no-show rates)

## 📊 Business Intelligence Potential

**Analytics Capabilities:**
- Dashboards for disease trends
- Hotspots identification
- Age/sex distributions analysis
- Treatment success monitoring
- Resource usage optimization
