## Project Overview
This is a multi-phase individual capstone project centered on Oracle database design, PL/SQL development, and Business Intelligence implementation. This project serves as the FINAL EXAM and significantly impacts the course grade.

## Problem Statement
Healthcare providers lack a unified system to track patient flows and disease-specific outcomes across reception, clinical, and lab departments. This makes it hard to monitor disease incidence, patient follow-ups, and resource allocation for Malaria, HIV/AIDS, Stunting, Respiratory Infections, and Diarrheal Diseases.

## Solution
A PL/SQL-backed Patient Tracking System that records patient registration, clinical encounters, diagnostics and treatments and produces BI-ready data for disease surveillance and decision-making.

## Context
Used in hospital outpatient departments and clinics to capture patient identity, visit lifecycle (reception → clinician → lab → treatment → follow-up) and disease-specific details.

## Target Users
Receptionists, Doctors, Lab Technicians, Pharmacists, Hospital Managers, Public Health Analysts.

## Project Goals
Accurate patient tracking, audit trail of all actions, disease incidence reports, KPI dashboards (incidence rates, treatment outcomes, no-show rates).

## BI Potential
Dashboards for disease trends, hotspots, age/sex distributions, treatment success, and resource usage.

## Project Phases
